The way you suggest inheritance in your proposal isnâ€™t exactly what we are looking for. An example would be the different tasks you ask the user to do. You have to be careful how you structure the actions / objects on the screen. 

A suggestion: Instead of using a keyboard, you can use color objects on the screen for the user to press to pick a guess. A submit button would be a button to submit their guess, so there would be another button to undo actions in case of mis-press. (Slowly building up a hierarchy of widgets)
