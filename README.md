This is your team's repo. Here you are able to pull, push and "maintain" your code. 
You will need to clone this repo like you did the C200 repo at the beginning of the course, C200-Assignments-username,where username is your username. Do **not** clone inside of your regular repository, but the same location. if you have any questions look on piazza to see if someone asked that question, if not then post your question
